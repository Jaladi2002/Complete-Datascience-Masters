Python Assignment 5
1. An empty dictionary’s code looks like {}
2. {‘foo’ : 42}
3. Lists are ordered collections of elements and can be accessed using indexes, whereas dictionary is an unordered collection of key-value pairs. Each key in the dictionary is unique and associated with a value. 
4. We would be getting a key error because the key value ‘foo’ does not exist.
5. There is no difference between ‘cat’ in spam and ‘cat’ in spam.keys() because both check if ‘cat’ is present in dictionary keys. 
6. ‘cat’ in  spam checks if ‘cat’ is present in any of the dictionary keys whereas ‘cat’ in spam.values() checks if ‘cat’ is present in values of a dictionary. 
7. spam.setdefault(‘color’,’black’)
8. The module is pprint(). The functions are pprint.pprint() and pprint.pformat()
